    "\n",
    "Vectors in NumPy can be defined over various numeric sets, which correspond to different possible vector spaces depending on the nature of their elements. Each type of vector is distinguished by the `dtype` (data type) of its components in the vector. Common data types include: integers (such as `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64`), complex numbers (typically `complex64` and `complex128`) and floating-point numbers (commonly `float16`, `float32`, and `float64`)\n",
